# Subflow: Connect to Metro dev server (Expo Dev Client)
# Handles two scenarios after app launch:
#   1. Developer menu modal (first launch) → tap "Continue"
#   2. Dev Client launcher (after clearState) → tap Metro URL
# Uses conditional runFlow (when: visible:) to handle either case.

# Case 2: Dev Client launcher appears (after clearState wipes Metro config)
